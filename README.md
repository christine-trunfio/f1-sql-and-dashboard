# f1-sql-and-dashboard
A training project involving a comprehensive SQL database analysis of the 2022 and 2023 Formula 1 seasons. The database was then connected to Power BI to create an exploratory report.

## Description
An SQL database designed and created entirely by me. The database served as the foundation for a group project in Power BI. A demonstrative PDF with the resulting dashboard and analysis is also included here.

#### Note: This project was developed as part of a training program in collaboration with two coursemates. It was created in a formative environment and may contain imperfections. The repository serves as a showcase of the coding and technical skills acquired during the training experience.
